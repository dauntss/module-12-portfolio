            I am a full stack web developer with a passion for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React on the front end, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the back end. I am a quick learner and a team player, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
